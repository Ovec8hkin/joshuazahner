The package reads a stack of interferograms and allows for easy plotting of surface ground displacements over time, enabling easier analysis.</p>\n<p>I worked on the MintPy software while an undergraduate at the University of Miami. During that time, I worked significantly on a script to output the results of MintPy's correction algorithms as a KMZ file for display and analysis in GIS programs. Due to the large volume of data output by MintPy's processing algorithms, the output KMZ file had to allow for multiple levels of detail depending on the viewing height within the GIS application, in order to be useable. At the highest view heights, only a few points were shown, and at the lowest view heights, the entire dataset for certain regions was displayed. The script also enable users to click on indivdiual data points within the GIS application to view numerical data about the given location including the deformation velocity of the specific geographic point as well as the total amount of deformation.</p>\n<p>I spent some time also working on a GUI for the MintPy software, which runs from the command line, but this project was eventually discarded in favor of other, more pressing, issues.</p>\n<h5>MintPy Citation</h5>\n<p>Yunjun, Z., H.
