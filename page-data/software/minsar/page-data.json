The software is intended to be run on a high performance computing or supercomputer cluster, and facilitates the automatic download and processing of remote InSAR data, allowing for scientists to spend more time analyzing the data. The package is in development by <a href=\"http://github.com/mirzaees\">Sara Mirzaee</a> and <a href=\"http://github/falkamelung\">Dr. Falk Amelung</a> at the Rosentiel School of Marine and Atmopsheric Science (RSMAS) in Miami, Florida. Regular contributions to the project are additionally made by other University of Miami graduate and undergraduate students.</p>\n<h4>My Contributions</h4>\n<p>I have worked on the MinSAR software package since 2018, while a student at RSMAS. I have spent significant time working on automating the downloading of data from remote satellite facilities as well as automating the entire processing routine -- from data download to analysis processing - on our available supercomputing cluster. Significant time was spent testing the routine on various HPC systems to ensure the software worked correctly under many of the most common scientific computing setups. In addition to these, I helped develop a <a href=\"/software/miami-insar-hazards-portal\">web application</a> which automatically displays the processed data images online for users to view and download.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Miami InSAR Software","date":"Mar 2018 - present","type":"Scientific Software Package","status":"ongoing","technologies":["Python"],"tags":["python","hpc"],"url":"https://rsmas-insar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/","repo":"https://github.com/geodesymiami/rsmas_insar","image":{"childImageSharp":{"sizes":{"src":"/static/7c07a67ff93274d0a2459d912d16f7cc/4cb16/mintpy.png"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/software/minsar"}}}
