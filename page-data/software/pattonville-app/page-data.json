The app allows for users to select one or more schools within the school district that they wish to receive information about, and then automatically displays recent news articles, upcoming calendar events, and helpful links related to that school or schools. The applications is completely self updating, pulling news articles and calendar events from an internal content management system, allowing it to stay in date alongside each school's website, as well as the district website.</p>\n<p>The app, which is available for both Android and iOS, was created by eight senior computer science students at Pattonville High School during the 2016-2017 school year as part of a computer science capstone project. It was released following the end of the school year, on June 1, 2017. </p>\n<h4>My Contributions</h4>\n<p>I personally, worked as a member of the iOS application team and worked extensively on the app's visual design and layout, as well as the data retrieval algorithms. I spent significant time implementing a way to retrieve and parse remote <em>.ics</em> (iCal calendar) files into an in-app calendar layout, as well as a means to display remote XML files as news articles in app, with functioning images and web links. </p>\n<h5>Related Links</h5>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&#x26;rct=j&#x26;q=&#x26;esrc=s&#x26;source=web&#x26;cd=9&#x26;ved=2ahUKEwiO2qnr7Y3nAhUJqlkKHZlhCh4QFjAIegQICRAB&#x26;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.stlamerican.com%2Fnews%2Flocal_news%2Fpattonville-students-create-app-for-school-district%2Farticle_5fdc99fe-507e-11e7-b02b-5b5ebd42163f.html&#x26;usg=AOvVaw2Y_RdFZW5MbmWKONyLCujM\">STL American Article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&#x26;rct=j&#x26;q=&#x26;esrc=s&#x26;source=web&#x26;cd=6&#x26;ved=2ahUKEwiO2qnr7Y3nAhUJqlkKHZlhCh4QFjAFegQIBRAB&#x26;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.psdr3.org%2F%3F%2FDistrict%2FNews%2FI0B0B1B3F&#x26;usg=AOvVaw0rLuJptuEnQDhJ5VhL54yE\">Pattonville School District Article</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Pattonville School District Mobile App","date":"Aug 2016 - Jun 2017","type":"Mobile Application","status":"complete","technologies":["Swift"],"tags":["mobile-app","ios","swift"],"url":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pattonville-school-district/id1220488120","repo":"https://github.com/Pattonville-App-Development-Team/ios-official","image":{"childImageSharp":{"sizes":{"src":"/joshuazahner/static/6761a967c0a7e343bd1a9bcd2a9b358f/7103c/psd-app.png"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/software/pattonville-app"}}}
