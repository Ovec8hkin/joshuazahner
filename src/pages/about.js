  <Layout pageTitle={'About Me'} active={"About"}>
    <p>I picked up programming after joining my highschool FIRST robotics team in 2014, and quickly fell in love with software development. I progressed from writing simple autonomous control programs for my team's annual robot, to designing websites in raw HTML, CSS, and javascript (this sounds like a downgrade, but I can assure you it's not), in the good ol' days before React, Vue, Node, and the rest of the modern javascript ecosystem emerged. I continued to develop websites and even a few mobile apps for the next four years of high school.</p>
    <p>In August 2017, I started at the University of Miami as a marine science and computer science double major. I have loved the ocean and all of the wildlife in it for as long as I can remember, and UM provided one of the very few programs where I could follow that passion in addition to the more stable field of computer science. I quickly found that my computational background and development skills were highly sought after in the ocean sciences domain, and so I began my journey into developing software for applications in the sciences.</p>
    <p>Outside of programming and science, I greatly enjoy traveling to and experiencing each of America's National Parks, which make up a majority of my body of photographic work. I also spend extensive time reading (mostly science fiction and fantasy, but I throw some environmental non-fiction in there to mix things up every once in a while) and watching NHL hockey (Let's Go Blues!).</p>
