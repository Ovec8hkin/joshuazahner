#### Project Overview
The VARS Explorer is an online data access and visualization portal built for the [Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute](http://mbari.org) Video Lab to provide online access to their video and image annotations database (VARS). The site is composed of a backend API written in Flask, and three frontend sites: one showing general database statistics, one allowing for complex querying of individual image annotations, and one for visualizing the distributions of various physical and environmental parameters associated with groups of annotations. 

_The site is owned and operated internally by the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, and additional information about the site, including component implementations, is unavailable at this time._
